# c7 CLI

Fetch library documentation using the `c7` CLI tool (`~/.local/bin/c7`).

## Commands

### Search Libraries

```bash
c7 search <libraryName> <query...>
```

Returns matching library IDs.

### Fetch Documentation Context

```bash
c7 context <libraryId> <query...> -t txt
```

Fetches documentation for the specified library ID. Default output format: `-t txt`.

## Workflow

1. **Search** — Run `c7 search` with the library name to get library IDs
2. **Context** — Run `c7 context` with the chosen library ID and query to fetch documentation

## Best Practices

- **Be specific with queries** — Use detailed, natural language queries for better results (e.g., `c7 context /vercel/next.js How to implement authentication with middleware` instead of just `auth`)
- **Use specific versions** — Pin to an exact version for consistent results (e.g., `c7 context /vercel/next.js/v15.1.8 app router`)
- **Handle 202 responses** — A 202 status means the library is not yet finalized; wait and retry later
- **Handle 301 redirects** — A 301 means the library ID has moved; use the new library ID from the response
